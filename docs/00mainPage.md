## Ella Greetis EGR314 Individual Report
Hello! My name is Ella Greetis and I'm a Robotics Engineering student. I'm in charge of the Bidirectional Internet Communication for team STEMteresting, where I'll be receiving the speed of the motor in RPM and the planet whose gravity this RPM represents, and will display that to an external user.
