## Description of Function: 
This schematic consist of a USB programmer, an ESP32, two debugging LEDs, one debugging pushbutton, two ribbon-cable headers, and a switching power regulator capable of stepping 7-40 Volts down to a steady 3.3V. The USB Programmer facilitates connection between the ESP32 and a personal computer. The Power Regulator allows for 

## Decision Making Process:
